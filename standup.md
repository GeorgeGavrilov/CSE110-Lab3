***Warning: This Page is ~~Amazing~~ Awful***

*This page only exists because my professor said that I need to create this*


Someone super wise once said:
> I am not lazy, I am just still buffering

And I can greatly relate to that, especially at the moment of making this webpage and trying to come up with ideas.

So far, my life on campus is more like this code snippet:
```
while (on_campus) {
        classes();
        eat();
        do_random_stuff();
        sleep();
}
```
My favorite video of all time is this video about ["How the universe was born"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

The current image also descibes how [I look like doing this lab](Lab1.jpeg)

My favorite things to do:
- Sleeping
- Walking
- More sleeping

My least favorite things to do(but this time ordered ðŸ˜²)
1. Waking up early
2. TOO much walking (e.g. walking back to my apartment across campus)

If you are wondering, my task list for today was:
- [x]  Drinking water
- [ ]  Finishing up the homework

Thanks for checking out this atrocious website!
